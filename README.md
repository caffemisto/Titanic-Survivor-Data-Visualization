# Udacity-Data-Visualization-Project
Project 6 for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This project will be a visual data analysis of a set of data regarding the mortality of those aboard the titanic.

#Summary
My visualization is going to illustrate data from the Titanic Dataset provided by the course. It will be a stacked bar graph that shows the number of survivors and casualties in the data from each passenger class. I have included an initial sketch in the repo. It has been distributed and I am currently awaiting feedback.
