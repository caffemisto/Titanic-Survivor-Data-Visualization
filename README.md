# Udacity-Data-Visualization-Project
Project 6 for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This project will be a visual data analysis of a set of data regarding the mortality of those aboard the titanic.

#Summary
My visualization is going to illustrate data from the Titanic Dataset provided by the course. It will be a stacked bar graph that shows the number of survivors and casualties in the data from each passenger class. I have included an initial sketch in the repo. It has been distributed and I am currently awaiting feedback.

#Feedback

Initial Sketch Feedback - 1
The first person to view my initial sketch mistook the meaning of the survivor and deceased bars upon first glance. They said a strong color contrast would make it easier to understand.

Initial Sketch Feedback - 2
The second person found the chart easier to understand but noted that they couldn't tell specifics, like totals or percentages. They said knowing this would make them more confident of their understanding.
